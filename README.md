# Catch the Ball

Catch the Ball is my second Unity project which is all about dropping the ball into the moving box

The project has 8 levels, each one differs from another in:
* amount of balls player has to drop sucessfully to the box
* amount of balls that player can use
* box speed

The project will be updated in the near future
