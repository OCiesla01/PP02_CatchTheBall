# Catch the Ball


Catch the Ball is my second Unity project, which involves throwing a ball into a moving box


The project has 8 levels, each of which differs:
* the number of balls the player must successfully throw into the box.
* the number of balls the player can use.
* the speed of the box.


The project will be updated in the near future.
